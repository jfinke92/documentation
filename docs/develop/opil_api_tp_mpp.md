# Motion Path Planning

The main target of the motion path planning is the calculation and coordination of robot paths. This is important to ensure a safe coexistence robots which operate together in the same environment. To ensure this, the path planner will always try to avoid crossing paths or blockings. 

## Introduction

The coordination of robots in logistics environments has special requirements and constraints related to the used routing algorithms and data representations. In almost all cases, current routing algorithms do not focus these requirements or are not able to integrate these due to inappropriate data representations. Special requirements for routing algorithms e.g. are routing of multiple robots to the same destination, handling of blocking robots that may lead to a deadlock situation, creation of order sequencing, managing heterogeneous robot fleets. The handling of scalability and performance when the number of robots increases is also a crucial issue. Especially in the latter case, a decentralized approach can help to fulfill these requirements. As mentioned before, requirements to the routing appear on the one side, on the other side the data representation of the logistics environment is a key factor. Special traffic regulations, like restricted driving directions (e.g. one way roads), or critical traffic situations, like narrow lanes, have to be mapped into a topological representation of the used routing algorithm. It is also necessary to depict vehicle positions and the positions of objects such as relocatable storage areas as a logistical environment which is in a state of constant changes, whereby all of these possible changes and requirements must be continuously updated in the data representation of the routing algorithm.

The used routing concept uses a topology which is based on a topological graph and a time window based routing.  

### Used Algorithm

The publication **C**ontext **A**ware **R**oute **P**lanning ***(CARP)*** approach of ***[ter Mors](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16178-0_14 "Context-Aware Route Planning")*** presents a central approach for collision-free navigation of autonomous systems. The algorithm is graph based and guaranties to calculate shortest paths from a start to a destination location, without colliding with any of the other robot, or ending up in a deadlock situation. For the path calculation and coordination time windows are used. Calculated routes can be defined as $\pi_n=\left(\left[r_1,\tau_1 \right], \dots,\left[r_n,\tau_n \right] \right), \tau_i=\left[t_i,t'_i\right)$  where $r_n$ is a node of the resource graph and $\tau_n$ is a time window that indicates that resource $r_n$ is available from time $t_i$ to $t'_i$, see subsequent figures. The basic idea of CARP can be defined as follows. Within routing, individual agents plan their routes successively one after the other. If an agent $n$ plans its route, the already planned $(n-1)$ routes are included in the current calculation. Every node of the resource graph has its own time windows that defines when the node is visitable. For planning conflict-free routes, overlapping time windows between the individual nodes of a route are required, in a way that $\tau\cap\tau'\neq\emptyset$. A calculation of the needed time windows takes place on the basis of real time values of the deployed vehicles. These values can be used to estimate the vehicle positions at a given time point. Based on this information the time windows of each node in the graph can be created. The algorithm also offers the possibility to integrate current events, such as delays, into the planning of future routes through a delay propagation approach.

## The Routing Concept

To establish a flexible and scalable path planning architecture, a new routing architecture will be presented, where an agent based approach is introduced. An overview of this agent model is shown in the subsequent figure. The chosen design provides possibility of a simple decentralization as well as reduction of the complexity of the routing algorithm by division into different agents. The presented approach consists of four different types of agents. Logical agents represent a software component which reacts to its environmental influences. In general, these agents have a more high level logic an serves as a manager. Logical and **R**obot **A**gent **N**ode (RAN), (mod.iot.ran) have a one to one relation, thus a logical agent is permanently assigned to a specific RAN agent and vise versa. RAN agents are rather simple agents and act as a driver for the real hardware and sends driving commands to and status information back to the logical agent. The responsibility for the routing is to calculate a path for the vehicle. This can be done in direct interaction with the topology. A route calculation is only possible within a direct coordination between the agents, whereby possible movements and solutions for critical situations are arranged. The developed routing concept mainly acts autonomously during the execution of an order. This includes the assignment of an order, the pick and place and subsequently the finish report. The interface to bring new orders to the system is the [TaskSupervisor](tasksupervisor.md "TaskSupervisor") which can interact with all available logical agents.

Subsequently all mentioned agents will be described in detail in the section [Agent descriptions](#agent-descriptions).

# Agent descriptions

This Section describes the developed decentralized agent based routing architecture in detail. Thereby a description of the responsibilities of the agents and the interaction among the agents is given. The main idea of this architecture relays on a distribution of responsibilities, knowledge and interactions among the agents. For this purpose, the agent offers services corresponding to it's tasks. To get in contact with other specific agents, only the knowledge of the individual ID is necessary.

## Routing Agents

The major task of the routing agent is to compute routes that are requested by the logical agents. For that reason, a routing service is offered to logical agents. This service allows to calculate real as well as test routes. The difference between is, time windows of test routes are not saved and do not serve as real routes. Information of a test route can be used during the negotiation process for new orders. While test routing, all necessary information, like the other routes are taken into account. Hence a test route consists of the following information: travel distance, travel time and way points of the topology. Based on this information a decision for the best agent for an order can be made. 
The used routing algorithm inside the routing agent corresponds to the CARP algorithm which is presented in chapter [Used Algorithm](#used-algorithm). The basis of the route calculation is a topology, managed by the topology agent. After the launch of a routing agent, the agent has no knowledge about the topology. The topology is dynamically built during the first route requests. Therefore a route request consists of a start id and destination id. With this, all needed information can be queried from the topology agents. Queried topology information are cached by the routing agent. This ensures that basic information like, connections, positions, restrictions, etc. are only requested once which reduces network traffic and ensures a maximum of dynamics. Free time windows and reservations of the topology is not cached and must be requested at any time required. After a route was successfully calculated by the routing agent, all calculated time slots are saved via a service call of the appropriate topology agent. Contrary to [Routing Concept](#The-Routing-Concept), the algorithm for the decentralized calculation of the routes has not yet been implemented in the current version of the router. Currently, the calculation of a route is only supported by one router at a time, but several router instances, e.g. specialized for the calculation for certain vehicles, can exist. This can be realized for example by a token between the routers.

## Topology Agents

The topology agent depicts the current representation of the logistics environment in a topology. This topology is offered to other agents, for example to the routing agent. In the case where a new route is calculated, the topology will be updated with reservation (time slots) of the calculated path. The reservation describes a time how long a vehicle or human will stay on a topology entity. In case of the topology, a topology entity can be represented by a vertex or an edge. One of the main tasks of a topology entity is the management of the reservations and calculation of free time slots for the routing through which new reservations can be calculated. 

For the time of a reservation, the topology entity is exclusively reserved for an specific agent. The calculation of reservations are part of the routing and are entered by the routing agent. In order to access a topology entity, it must be first reserved by a logical agent. Only the agent with the next reservation receives the surcharge. Other agents can already request the point for an allocation, but have to wait until it is released from the previously allocating agent. To know when a point is traveled or left, every topology entity has a footprint. The footprint describes an area that may not be navigated on if it has not been validly allocated, as well as an area that can be safely navigated on if it has been allocated. A footprint is described by a 2D polygon course. Every topology entity, vertex and edge, consists of such a footprint. 

Another important task of the topology is the management of important information like connections and restrictions. In case of a vertex, connections are edges which are connected with the vertex. In this case the vertex stores the ID of the connected edges, but has no further information. In case of an edge, the connecting vertex IDs (1 in case of an unidirectional edge, 2 in case of an bidirectional edge) are stored, also without further knowledge. It is the responsibility of the requesting agent to obtain further information from the adjacent agent. Restrictions of a topology entity can be for example a maximum velocity, special vehicle types, a maximum payload, etc. A topology entity can also be locked for a specific time interval. During this period a reservation and allocation of the topology entity is not possible for an agent. Locks are very helpful if something went wrong on the shop floor, or e.g. a vehicle has an technical problem. In terms of a delay, a delay propagation can be performed. In this case, the delayed logical agent informs the topology entity of the delay, causing it to postpone the reservation for the informing as well as all of the following logical agents. All following logical agents will be informed of the delay by the topology entity.

Each vertical time line corresponds to one topology entity (vertices: $v_1, v_2, v_3$ and edges: $e_1, e_2$). The grey colored reservation ($r_n$) illustrates a planned path of a vehicle. Between reservations of a topology entity, free time windows ($f_n$) can be build which can serve for new reservations.](../imgs/reservation_free_time_slots.png)

## Logical Agent

The logical agent is a high level manager for RAN, or in other words for a vehicle or human. Main task for the logical agent are for example the order management, which includes the participation of order actions, the route management and status updating of orders. New orders are assigned to the logical agents via order auctions. Here, the logical agent prepare bids for tendered contracts. A central instance selects the best logical agent for the respective order and assigns the order to it. A more detailed description of the order auction is given in chapter [Decision making](#Decision-making). In case a route is assigned to a logical agent, the agent retrieves the acknowledge from the auction strategy and the order will be stored in a queue. 
Another main task of the logical agent is the route management. After a new task is picked from the queue, a path has to be calculated to the picking and placing location of the order. After a path has been received from the routing agent, the RAN agent can start traversing the path. Therefore the logical agents start with the allocation of topology entities which are a part of the calculated path and already reserved by the routing agent. After a topology entity is successfully allocated, the position can be send as a driving command to the RAN agent. The task of the logical agent is now to check whether the calculated time slots for this path segment are adhered to and the footprint of the path is not left by the RAN agent. In case that the calculated time windows cannot be kept, a delay propagation will be carried out by the logical agent. The challenge here is to predict how long the delay will be. However, since this can depend on a wide variety of influences, no prediction has been made. Influences can be for example: blocked way, a person steps in front of a vehicle, the prediction of the time window was not precise, etc. Therefore a static time is currently propagated as delay. After a topology entity was traversed and the footprint of the topology entity is not longer occupied by the RAN agent footprint, the topology entity can be deallocated by the logical agent.
For handling errors, if the RAN agent for example is a vehicle, the logical agent continuously receives status information of the RAN agent. Beside information like position, finished orders etc., errors are send to the logical agents. Some failures can be handled by the agent itself, others has to be handled by an operator. Protective field errors for example can be handled by the logical agent. If the error can not be handled by the logical agent, by for e.g. waiting for a defined amount of time and propagating a delay, the error will be forwarded to an operator. 

### Decision making

In our scenario, a logical agent delivers for example ordered parts from a shelf-based warehouse to workstations on the shop floor. Therefore the basic logical agent was extended by a behavior to process transport orders from the fleetmanager. To obtain orders, a logical agent sends bids on auctioned transport orders. For this purpose, the logical agent has an additional behavior to conduct contract negotiations. Auction for orders are given in the form of a direct inquiry of a logical agent and a request to submit a bid. The bid of a logical agent includes information such as: travel distance and travel time which can be received from a routing agent via a test route, battery life and actual workload of the logical agent. For the test route it is important to know the possible start time and start position, which equivalent to the end time and position of the last order in the queue. If the queue is empty, the start time and position corresponds to the current time and position. 

In our agent model the auctions for orders takes place between the logical agents and the Fleetmanager. For the included auction in this decision point the FIPA CNET protocol was applied. [Branisso et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6825356 "A Multi-Agent System Using Fuzzy Logic to Increase AGV Fleet Performance in Warehouses") pointed out that CNET produces a larger task throughput as the First Come First Serve approach. All of the following input values are part of a bid that was sent from a supply logical agent to the warehouse agent during a transport order auction. Three input values are used at this decision point. More precisely, these are the travel distance between the source and destination location, the travel time and the battery charging state of the vehicle. The auction process between the fleetmanager and the logical agents is shown in the figure below.
