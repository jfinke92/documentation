# Overview

OPIL is the **Open Platform** for **Innovations** in **Logistcs**.
This platform is meant to enable the development of value added services for the logistics sector 
in small-scale Industry 4.0 contexts such as those of the manufacturing SMEs.
In fact it provides an easy deployable suite of applications for rapid development of complete logistics solutions; 
these include components for path planning, mapping, navigation and so on.

On the other hand OPIL provides ready connectivity with equipments for optimal material handling on factory floor.
These include (but not limited to) mobile robots, AGVs, forklifts, workers and sensors as well as IT infrastructure of the factory such as various warehouse management and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. 
OPIL also provides a ready integration with a state of the art 3D factory simulator (with mobile robots, AGVs, forklifts, workers and sensors) allowing the complete development and testing of logistics solutions virtually, and presenting them to factories before actual implementation;
3D simulator provides support for the estimation of investment and guides the orchestration of the deployment tasks. 

A messaging system at the heart of OPIL, which is based on the **FIWARE open architecture**, handles interactions among the several components of platform as well as with the external ones.
The open architecture of OPIL supports the usage of open-source frameworks such as ROS (Robot Operating System) for the development of new components, e.g. perception, mobile manipulation, etc.
